# BackupPC installation script

This was my introduction to shell scripting, and if I were to do it again, a lot would be different XD. 
That being said, the script does serve its purpose and has proven to be a useful tool for setting up BackupPC quickly and efficiently.
It doesnt really have any error handling lol

The script automatically installs and configures BackupPC on a ubuntu server.
It will also setup a client.

###How to use:

- stage1.sh should run on the server.

- stage2.sh should run on the client.

- stage3.sh should run on the server again, after running stage 1.
