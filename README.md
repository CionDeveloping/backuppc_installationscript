# BackupPC installation script

This was my intro to shell scripting, if i would do it again alot would be different XD

The script automatically installs and configures BackupPC on a ubuntu server.
It will also setup a client.

###How to use:

- stage1.sh should run on the server.

- stage2.sh should run on the client.

- stage3.sh should run on the server again, after running stage 1.
